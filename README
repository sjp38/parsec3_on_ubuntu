History
=======

This is a fork of the
[parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial](https://github.com/sjp38/parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial),
which was made to support Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) only.  Yunjae has made it to
additionally support Bionic (18.04), and as a result this fork has made.  Note
that the previous version (parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial) is not deprecated.
