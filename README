This is a toolbox for the parsec 3.0 benchmark installation and execution on
Ubuntu.  Currently, it supports Xenial (16.04) and Bionic (18.04).


Getting Started
===============

Open terminal, move to this directory, and follow below scripts.

    $ ./getsrc.sh
    $ ./patch.sh
    $ ./install_deps.sh
    $ ./build.sh
    $ ./run.sh canneal

Each of the commands fetches source code of parsec 3.0 (`getsrc.sh`), modifies
the source code to be successfully built on Ubuntu (`patch.sh`), installs
dependent packages (`install_deps.sh`), build the parsec 3.0 benchmark
(`build.sh`), and finally runs canneal package of the benchmark (`run.sh
canneal`).


SPLASH-2x
=========

Parsec 3.0 includes SPLASH-2X benchmark suite.  You can also build and run it
using the tools.  For build, simply run the build script with an additional
argument, `splash2x`:

    $ ./build.sh splash2x

Build of specific splash2x package is also available:

    $ ./build.sh splash2x.water_nsquared

After that, to run a benchmark package of SPLASH-2X, use the `run.sh` but
prefix `splash2x.` to the package name:

    $ ./run.sh splash2x.water_nsquared


History
=======

This is a fork of the
[parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial](https://github.com/sjp38/parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial),
which was made to support Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) only.  Yunjae has made it to
additionally support Bionic (18.04), and as a result this fork has made.  Note
that the previous version (parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial) is deprecated.
