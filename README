This is a toolbox for the parsec 3.0 benchmark installation and execution on
Ubuntu.  Currently, it supports Xenial (16.04) and Bionic (18.04).


Getting Started
===============

Open terminal, move to this directory, and follow below scripts:

    $ ./build.sh
    $ ./run.sh canneal

The first command (`build.sh`) will get source code of parsec 3.0, modifies the
source code to be successfully built on Ubuntu, installs dependent packages,
and build the parsec 3.0 benchmark packages.  Then, the second command runs
canneal package of the benchmark (`run.sh canneal`).

Each of the four steps of the `build.sh` can be done via below 4 separate
scripts, respectively:

    $ ./_getsrc.sh
    $ ./_patch.sh
    $ ./_install_deps.sh
    $ ./_build.sh


SPLASH-2x
=========

Parsec 3.0 includes SPLASH-2X benchmark suite.  You can also build and run it
using the tools.  For build, simply run the internal build script with an
additional argument, `splash2x`:

    $ ./_build.sh splash2x

Build of specific splash2x package is also available:

    $ ./_build.sh splash2x.water_nsquared

After that, to run a benchmark package of SPLASH-2X, use the `run.sh` but
prefix `splash2x.` to the package name:

    $ ./run.sh splash2x.water_nsquared


History
=======

This is a fork of the
[parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial](https://github.com/sjp38/parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial),
which was made to support Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) only.  Yunjae has made it to
additionally support Bionic (18.04), and as a result this fork has made.  Note
that the previous version (parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial) is deprecated.
