This repository is a toolbox for parsec 3.0 benchmark installation and
execution on Ubuntu.  Currently, it supports Xenial (16.04) and Bionic (18.04).


Quick Tutorial
==============

Following is a quick tutorial for use of the tools in this toolbox.  Each
example command assumes that your current working directory(`cwd`) is this
repository.

Get source code of parsec 3.0
```
$ ./getsrc.sh
```

Modify source code to be successfully built on Ubuntu Xenial or Bionic
```
$ ./patch.sh
```

Install dependent packages
```
$ ./install_dep-xenial.sh
```
or
```
$ ./install_dep-bionic.sh
```

Build parsec 3.0 benchmark
```
$ ./build.sh
```

Run canneal package of parsec 3.0
```
$ ./run.sh canneal
```


SPLASH-2x
=======

Parsec 3.0 includes SPLASH-2X benchmark suite.  You can also build and run it
using this tool.  For build of it, simply run the build script with an
additional argument, `splash2x`:
```
$ ./build.sh splash2x
```

You can also build only a specific package as below:
```
$ ./build.sh splash2x.water_nsquared
```

After that, to run a benchmark package of SPLASH-2X, use the `run.sh` but
prefix `splash2x` to the package name:
```
$ ./run.sh splash2x.water_nsquared
```


History
=======

This is a fork of the
[parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial](https://github.com/sjp38/parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial),
which was made to support Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) only.  Yunjae has made it to
additionally support Bionic (18.04), and as a result this fork has made.  Note
that the previous version (parsec_on_ubuntu_xenial) is deprecated.
